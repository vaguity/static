# Static

## A site framework

This repo:

1. puts all the front-end stuff I've found useful in one place,
1. keeps all of those dependencies tracked by their package managers so they're under version control and can be easily updated, and
1. provides a modifiable workflow in one place that produces an uncluttered static site in `/dist`.
